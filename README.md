# ₿ Bitcoin Wallet Scanner

An educational tool for learning Bitcoin cryptography, wallet generation, and address formats.

⚠️ **Educational purposes only** - This tool demonstrates Bitcoin concepts and does not find real wallets.

## Features

- **Wallet Scanning Simulation** - Multi-threaded scanning demonstration
- **Wallet Generation** - Create Bitcoin wallets with all key formats
- **Address Validator** - Validate Bitcoin address formats
- **Private Key Analysis** - Analyze keys and derive addresses
- **Real-time Statistics** - Live scanning metrics and progress

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Usage

- Click **Start Scanning** to begin the simulation
- Use **Generate Wallet** to create new Bitcoin wallets
- Try the **Educational Tools** to validate addresses and analyze keys
- View **Found Wallets** (extremely rare) and **Activity Log**

## Technology

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, bitcoinjs-lib
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Web Workers
- **APIs:** Blockstream.info, BlockCypher

## Important Notes

- This is a **learning tool** - finding wallets with balance is mathematically impossible
- **Never share private keys** generated by this or any tool
- All wallet generation uses cryptographically secure random numbers
- Real blockchain APIs are used for balance checking and validation
